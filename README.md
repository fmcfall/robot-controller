# Wearable Controller for Robot-Assisted Microsurgery

This reporsitory contains the files used for my final year project, in which I designed a Wearable Controller for Robot-Assisted Microsurgery.

The folders contain the following files:
- filters:
  - kf.py - kalman filter class
  - ekf.py - extended kalman filter class
  - ukf.py - unscented kalman filter class
- tests:
  - implementations of all filters
  - test files used for the results
- old tests:
  - individual filter testing files
- aruco:
  - aruco generation and detection scripts

The video of the code running using micromanipulator is found at:
